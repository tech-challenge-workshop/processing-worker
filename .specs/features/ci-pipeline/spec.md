# Processing Worker CI Pipeline Specification

## Problem Statement

The Worker repository has no automated verification. It is also the service whose media processing and concurrency envelope are about to be implemented, so the gate must exist before that work lands.

CI/CD is an explicit technical requirement of the challenge (RT-5) and no repository has a workflow today. Branch protection on `main` is already active, so the quality gate must exist before it can be required as a status check.

## Goals

- [ ] Run the established quality gates on every pull request targeting `main`.
- [ ] Keep job names stable so branch protection can require them as status checks.
- [ ] Fail the check on any non-zero exit, with no manual step.

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Deployment or registry publication | Belongs to S9a, once manifests exist. |
| Cluster provisioning and environment approval | Belongs to S9a. |
| Changing test, lint, or build behaviour | This slice wires the existing gates; it does not alter them. |
| Coverage thresholds that fail the build | Reporting first; enforcing a number without a baseline blocks work arbitrarily. |
| FFmpeg availability in the runner | No test invokes FFmpeg yet; it becomes a CI concern when S4 lands. |

## Assumptions & Open Questions

Every ambiguity is resolved or recorded here - nothing is left silently unclear.

| Assumption / decision | Chosen default | Rationale | Confirmed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Runner image | `ubuntu-latest` | The services target Linux containers; no Windows or macOS behaviour is exercised. | y |
| Node version | 22 | Matches `node:22-alpine` in the Dockerfile. No `engines` field exists, so the Dockerfile is the only stated source. | y |
| Dependency install | `npm ci` against the committed lockfile | Reproducible, and it fails loudly when the lockfile drifts from `package.json`. | y |
| Triggers | Pull requests targeting `main`, and pushes to `main` | Matches the protected-branch workflow already in use. | y |
| Lint strictness | Zero errors **and** zero warnings | The existing gate already requires this; CI must not be weaker than the local gate. | y |
| Secrets | The quality gate uses none | Nothing in lint, test or build reaches an external service, which keeps runs reproducible for any contributor. | y |
| End-to-end suite in CI | Runs in the same job as the unit tests | The Worker e2e suite mocks the RabbitMQ client, so the suite needs no broker. | y |
| FFmpeg in the runner | Not installed in this slice | No current test shells out to FFmpeg. Installing it now would be unused setup; S4 revisits this. | y |

**Open questions:** none - all resolved or logged above.

## User Stories

### P1: Quality gate on every pull request ⭐ MVP

**User Story**: As a maintainer, I want lint, tests and build to run automatically on every pull request so that `main` never receives a change that breaks the established gates.

**Why P1**: RT-5 requires CI, and branch protection cannot require a status check that does not exist.

**Acceptance Criteria** (each line is one EARS pattern):

1. WHEN a pull request targets `main` THEN the workflow SHALL run dependency install, lint, unit tests, end-to-end tests, and build. <!-- event-driven -->
2. WHEN any gate step exits non-zero THEN the workflow SHALL fail the check run. <!-- event-driven -->
3. WHEN the workflow installs dependencies THEN it SHALL use `npm ci` against the committed `package-lock.json`. <!-- event-driven -->
4. WHEN the workflow selects a runtime THEN it SHALL use Node 22. <!-- event-driven -->
5. WHEN a commit is pushed to `main` THEN the workflow SHALL run the same gate. <!-- event-driven -->
6. IF lint reports at least one error or warning THEN the workflow SHALL fail. <!-- unwanted-behavior -->
7. The workflow SHALL expose a stable job name so branch protection can require it as a status check. <!-- ubiquitous -->
8. The quality gate SHALL require no repository secret to run. <!-- ubiquitous -->

**Independent Test**: Open a pull request with a deliberate lint error and confirm the check fails; remove it and confirm the check passes.

---

### P2: Container image build

**User Story**: As a maintainer, I want the image to be built in CI so that a Dockerfile regression is caught in the pull request rather than at deploy time.

**Why P2**: The gate is useful without it, but a broken image only surfaces later, when it is more expensive.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. WHEN the quality gate passes THEN the workflow SHALL build the container image from the repository `Dockerfile`. <!-- event-driven -->
2. IF the image build exits non-zero THEN the workflow SHALL fail the check run. <!-- unwanted-behavior -->
3. The workflow SHALL NOT push the image to any registry. <!-- ubiquitous -->

**Independent Test**: Break a `COPY` path in the Dockerfile and confirm the pull request check fails.

---

### P3: Coverage reporting

**User Story**: As a maintainer, I want a coverage summary published per run so that test coverage is visible before we decide whether to enforce a threshold.

**Why P3**: Reporting informs a future decision; it changes no outcome today.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. WHEN unit tests run THEN the workflow SHALL produce a coverage summary retained as a run artifact. <!-- event-driven -->
2. The coverage result SHALL NOT fail the check run. <!-- ubiquitous -->

---

## Edge Cases

- IF `package-lock.json` is out of sync with `package.json` THEN `npm ci` SHALL fail the workflow rather than resolve a different dependency tree.
- IF a newer commit is pushed to the same pull request THEN the superseded run SHALL be cancelled so the reported status reflects the current head.
- IF a job exceeds 15 minutes THEN it SHALL time out and fail rather than occupy a runner indefinitely.
- WHEN the repository contains AppleDouble sidecar files committed from the working volume THEN the workflow SHALL still pass, because a clean checkout contains none.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] A pull request to `main` reports a passing check produced only by CI.
- [ ] A deliberately broken lint rule, test, or build fails that check.
- [ ] The check name is selectable in the branch protection settings as a required status check.
